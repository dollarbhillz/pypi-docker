Instructions for building this image in OSBS
--------------------------------------------

Step One: Create a dist-git repo and checkout a new branch called eng-rhel-7

Step Two: SSH into rcm-dev and clone into that dist-git repo ($ git clone ssh://pkgs.devel.redhat.com/rpms/<name-of-repo>) in your home directory

Step Three: SCP the files from your local machine to the folder you just made in your home directory

Step Four: 'git add' the files, then

$ rhpkg commit

...proper commit message...

$ rhpkg push

$ rhpkg container-build --target eng-rhel-7-container-candidate

Step Five: Wait for OSBS to build the container image

...

Step Six: $ sudo docker pull <whatever brew spits out as the link to the image>

Congratulations! You have your very own container image! Give yourself a pat on the back!
